<h1><b>🔗 BlockChain</b></h1>

**Blockchain Technology** is a shared, unchangeable digital database spread across a network of computers, recording transactions in "blocks" linked chronologically with cryptography, creating a secure, transparent, and decentralized system for tracking assets and data without a central authority like a bank. Once data is added to a block and chained, it's nearly impossible to alter, requiring network consensus (agreement) to validate changes, ensuring high security and trust.
