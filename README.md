<h1><b>BlockChain</b></h1>

**Blockchain technology** is a shared, unchangeable digital database spread across a network of computers, recording transactions in "blocks" linked chronologically with cryptography, creating a secure, transparent, and decentralized system for tracking assets and data without a central authority like a bank. Once data is added to a block and chained, it's nearly impossible to alter, requiring network consensus (agreement) to validate changes, ensuring high security and trust.

Its key characteristics are: 

- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls it; copies exist on many computers (nodes). 
- **Immutable**: Data, once recorded, cannot be changed or deleted without altering all subsequent blocks and getting network approval. 
- **Transparent**: All participants can see the shared ledger, allowing for easy tracking and auditing. 
- **Secure**: Uses cryptography (hashes) to link blocks, making tampering evident. 
- **Consensus-driven**: Transactions are verified by the network, not a middleman, through agreement mechanisms.
