<h1><b>🔗 BlockChain</b></h1>

**Blockchain Technology** is a shared, unchangeable digital database spread across a network of computers, recording transactions in "blocks" linked chronologically with cryptography, creating a secure, transparent, and decentralized system for tracking assets and data without a central authority like a bank. Once data is added to a block and chained, it's nearly impossible to alter, requiring network consensus (agreement) to validate changes, ensuring high security and trust.

Its key characteristics are: 

- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls it; copies exist on many computers (nodes). 
- **Immutable**: Data, once recorded, cannot be changed or deleted without altering all subsequent blocks and getting network approval. 
- **Transparent**: All participants can see the shared ledger, allowing for easy tracking and auditing. 
- **Secure**: Uses cryptography (hashes) to link blocks, making tampering evident. 
- **Consensus-driven**: Transactions are verified by the network, not a middleman, through agreement mechanisms. 

<h1><b>🌐 Web3</b></h1>

**Web3** is the vision for the next generation of the internet, shifting from today's centralized platforms (Web2) to a decentralized, user-owned web built on blockchain, focusing on data ownership, privacy, and control for users, rather than big tech companies. It uses technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrency, NFTs, smart contracts, and dApps to create a more open, transparent, and censorship-resistant internet where users have direct say in platforms and digital assets.

Web3 aims to let communities and open protocols control infrastructure and rules through code, tokens, and smart contracts.

→ From Web1 and Web2 to Web3:
- Web1 (roughly 1990s–early 2000s) focused on static websites where most users just read information; content and hosting were controlled by site owners.

- Web2 (mid‑2000s onward) introduced dynamic, interactive platforms like social networks, app stores, and cloud services, but concentrated control of data and monetization in large “Big Tech” platforms.​

- Web3 combines the richer interactivity of Web2 with decentralized infrastructure from blockchain and peer‑to‑peer networks, so that no single company has unilateral control over data, identity, or value flows
